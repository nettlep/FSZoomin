# Legacy Code Resurrection Project

This file is part of a glorious rescue mission: migrating ancient code from the dusty vaults of the internet to the shiny halls of GitHub.

This code has been preserved as faithfully as possible, warts and all. All code contained herein is original code written by Paul Nettle unless otherwise noted.

## Original description

FSZoom allows you to magnify regions of your screen.

Once in a while, you need to work with pixels (especially if you do a lot of graphics programming.) This is one of those tools I use on a regular basis because it allows you to set up a zoom region, and as you work, the zoom auto-updates, showing you a live zoom view.

There are probably other zoom-in utilities out there like this, but this one is free. :)

- Original source code with minimal modifications  
- Historical comments and design choices, preserved for posterity  
- A fresh coat of licensing and documentation (hello `LICENSE` and `README.md`!)

## Why preserve this?

Because history matters. This code is a snapshot of how things were done back then—and in some cases, how they’re still done today. Think of it as open source time travel.

Happy coding!
